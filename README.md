This is a SQLite extension that provides integration with the libexif library. After the extension is loaded, two new SQL functions become available:

```
FILE_EXIF_READ(PATHNAME, IFD, TAG): retrieve the value of Exif tag IFD/TAG
BLOB_EXIF_READ(BLOB, IFD, TAG)    : same as FILE_EXIF, but reads Exif contents from a BLOB instead of a file
```

Usage example from the SQLite shell:

```
.load "sqlite3ext_exif-1"

SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('20231030_150218.jpg', 'EXIF_IFD_0',    'Orientation');      -- returns a string like 'Top-left'
SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('20231030_150218.jpg', 'EXIF_IFD_EXIF', 'DateTimeOriginal'); -- returns a string like '2023:10:30 15:02:18'
SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('20231030_150218.jpg', 'EXIF_IFD_EXIF', 'FNumber');		   -- returns a string like 'F/2.2'
SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('20231030_150218.jpg', 'EXIF_IFD_EXIF', 'ISOSpeedRatings');  -- returns a string like '40'
SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('20231030_150218.jpg', 'EXIF_IFD_EXIF', 'ExposureTime');	   -- returns a string like '1/1379 sec.'

Here's a list of EXIF tags extracted from `libexif`'s source file `exif-tag.c`:

- `SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('myfile.jpg', 'IFD_0', 'Artist');`
  **Artist**: This tag records the name of the camera owner, photographer or image creator. The detailed format is not specified, but it is recommended that the information be written as in the example below for ease of Interoperability. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
- `SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('myfile.jpg', 'IFD_0', 'BitsPerSample');`
  **Bits per Sample**: The number of bits per image component. In this standard each component of the image is 8 bits, so the value for this tag is 8. See also <SamplesPerPixel>. In JPEG compressed data a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag.
- `SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('myfile.jpg', 'IFD_0', 'Compression');`
  **Compression**: The compression scheme used for the image data. When a primary image is JPEG compressed, this designation is not necessary and is omitted. When thumbnails use JPEG compression, this tag value is set to 6.
- `SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('myfile.jpg', 'IFD_0', 'Copyright');`
  **Copyright**: Copyright information. In this standard the tag is used to indicate both the photographer and editor copyrights. It is the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.". In this standard the field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case, since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes) (see example 1). When only the photographer is given, it is terminated by one NULL code (see example 2). When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given (see example 3). When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.

- `SELECT FILE_EXIF_READ('myfile.jpg', 'IFD_0', 'YCbCrPositioning');`
  **YCbCr Positioning**: The position of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. This field is designated only for JPEG compressed data or uncompressed YCbCr data. The TIFF default is 1 (centered); but when Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:2 it is recommended in this standard that 2 (co-sited) be used to record data, in order to improve the image quality when viewed on TV systems. When this field does not exist, the reader shall assume the TIFF default. In the case of Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:0, the TIFF default (centered) is recommended. If the reader does not have the capability of supporting both kinds of <YCbCrPositioning>, it shall follow the TIFF default regardless of the value in this field. It is preferable that readers be able to support both centered and co-sited positioning.

Stipulations on audio and file naming conventions are defined in the specification. When using this tag, audio files must be recorded in conformance to the Exif audio format. Writers are also allowed to store the data such as Audio within APP2 as FlashPix extension stream data. The mapping of Exif image files and audio files is done in any of three ways, [1], [2] and [3]. If multiple files are mapped to one file as in [2] or [3], the above format is used to record just one audio file name. If there are multiple audio files, the first recorded file is given. In the case of [3], for example, for the Exif image file "DSC00001.JPG" only  "SND00001.WAV" is given as the related Exif audio file.

By combining multiple relational information, a variety of playback possibilities can be supported. The method of using relational information is left to the implementation on the playback side. Since this information is an ASCII character string, it is terminated by NULL. When this tag is used to map audio files, the relation of the audio file to image data must also be indicated on the audio file end.

  **User Comment**: A tag for Exif users to write keywords or comments on the image besides those in <ImageDescription>, and without the character code limitations of the <ImageDescription> tag. The character code used in the <UserComment> tag is identified based on an ID code in a fixed 8-byte area at the start of the tag data area. The unused portion of the area is padded with NULL ("00.h"). ID codes are assigned by means of registration. The designation method and references for each character code are defined in the specification. The value of CountN is determined based on the 8 bytes in the character code area and the number of bytes in the user comment part. Since the TYPE is not ASCII, NULL termination is not necessary. The ID code for the <UserComment> area may be a Defined code such as JIS or ASCII, or may be Undefined. The Undefined name is UndefinedText, and the ID code is filled with 8 bytes of all "NULL" ("00.H"). An Exif reader that reads the <UserComment> tag must have a function for determining the ID code. This function is not required in Exif readers that do not use the <UserComment> tag. When a <UserComment> area is set aside, it is recommended that the ID code be ASCII and that the following user comment part be filled with blank characters [20.H].

### How to compile

`libexif` is a mandatory dependency and must be already be installed on the system; and command `gcc ... -lexif` must not fail.
`libexif` is LGPL and can be built from source code, which is available [here](https://github.com/libexif/libexif/).

Once this preliminary is satisfied, proceed with the usual configure/make sequence:


```
	./configure
	make all
	ls -l src/.libs/sqlite3ext_exif*.{so,dll} # binary is generated in this folder
```

### How to compile (statically link libexif)

It is possible to perform an alternative build that links libexif statically:

```
	./configure --with-libexifstatic
	make all
	ls -l src/.libs/sqlite3ext_exif*.{so,dll} # binary is generated in this folder
	ldd src/.libs/sqlite3ext_exif*.{so,dll}   # libexif will not appear in the dependencies list
```

### How to compile (statically link everything)

The following build script compiled successfully a .so module with no dynamic dependencies at all:

```
make all CFLAGS="-fPIC -static" LIBS=" -Wl,-Bstatic,-lsqlite3,-lexif,-Bdynamic"

gcc -shared -nodefaultlibs \
  -o src/.libs/sqlite3ext_exif.so \
  -Wl,--whole-archive,-L./src/.libs,-l:sqlite3ext_exif.a,--no-whole-archive \
  -Wl,-Bstatic,-lsqlite3,-lexif,-Bdynamic

ldd src/.libs/sqlite3ext_exif.so
```
